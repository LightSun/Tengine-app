# Tengine-app
This is a repository for applications powered by Tengine. Please feel free to try them on your device.

### Application List:

#### 1.  [Android Image Classification](https://github.com/OAID/Tengine-app/tree/master/android/classification)

​      This App based on the Tengine engine can classify Images from your Devices.

#### 2.  [Android Object Detection](https://github.com/OAID/Tengine-app/tree/master/android/detection)

​      This App based on the Tengine engine can detect multiple objects in Images from your Devices.

#### 3.  [Realtime Image Classification](https://github.com/OAID/Tengine-app/tree/master/android/Realtime-Classify)

​      This App based on the Tengine engine can classify Images from your camera.

#### 4.  [Realtime Object Detection](https://github.com/OAID/Tengine-app/tree/master/android/Realtime-Detect)

​      This App based on the Tengine engine can detect multiple objects from your camera.

#### 5.  [Image Classification (AAR)](https://github.com/OAID/Tengine-app/tree/master/android/Realtimeclassify(aar))

​      This App based on the Tengine engine can classify Images from your camera.

#### 6.  [Object Detection (AAR)](https://github.com/OAID/Tengine-app/tree/master/android/Realtimedetect(aar))

​      This App based on the Tengine engine can detect multiple objects from your camera.

- No.3 and No.5 projects are both realtime image classification. No.4 and No.6 projects are both realtime object detection. Except No.5 & 6 are implemented by AAR, and No.3 & 4 are implemented by pure JNI. The difference is that AAR is more space efficient than JNI.
